## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-14
### Changed
- **Breaking change:** `ZeroElevationCheck` now counts **one error per entity** (instead of per vertex) when zero/missing elevations are found.
- **Breaking change:** Zero/missing elevation markers are now placed **at the centroid** of all offending points for the entity, instead of one marker per offending vertex. Removed automatic circle drawing around each point.
- Expanded HATCH entity handling:
  - In **entity extraction**, now includes HATCH entities inside both modelspace and block definitions.
  - In **point extraction**, supports both `PolylinePath` and `EdgePath` (line edges and arc edges), with proper 3D normalization.
  - In **zero elevation check**, inspects each HATCH point individually, respecting tolerance, and logs detailed diagnostics.
- Enhanced verbose logging throughout entity extraction and zero elevation checks:
  - Entity-type counts for both modelspace and block contents.
  - Detailed HATCH path types and sample points.
  - Closed-polygon detection for polylines.
  - Sample point previews and explicit tolerance reporting.

### Added
- Centroid calculation helper for consolidating zero-elevation point locations into a single marker.
- Summary log of total entities extracted (direct vs from blocks).

### Impact
- **Scripts/tests depending on previous per-vertex error counts or markers will need updating** to handle the new per-entity counting and centroid-based marking.
- HATCH entities within blocks are now processed and may surface additional issues that were previously undetected.

### Type
- **Major** â€” due to changes in error counting and marker placement behavior that can affect downstream processing.
